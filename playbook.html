      <h2>The Opportunity Project Playbook</h2>
      <p id="introduction"><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/03/07/fact-sheet-white-house-launches-opportunity-project-utilizing-open-data">The Opportunity Project</a> is catalyzing the creation of new digital tools that use federal and local data to increase access to opportunity in communities around the country. By providing easy access to curated federal and local datasets at  <a href="http://opportunity.census.gov">opportunity.census.gov</a>, and by facilitating collaboration between technologists, subject matter experts, and local leaders, we are transforming government data into digital tools that meet needs like helping families to find affordable housing near jobs and transportation, connecting unemployed Americans with jobs that match their skills, and enabling local leaders to use data to better target investments.</p>

      <p>We created this playbook as a guide for anyone who wants to use the Opportunity Project process to create more equitable communities. We hope that many people can benefit from this process, including federal agencies seeking new digital solutions for the public, teachers who want their students to learn how to use government data to solve local and national problems, local governments who want their data to be put to use to address the needs of residents, community groups looking to partner with tech talent to build capacity to advance their missions, and more.</p>

      <p>This process is not one size fits all – it will look different depending on who you are and what big challenges you want to solve. The steps below reflect lessons we’ve learned through federally-led design sprints, and working with local governments, tech companies, experts, coding schools, and community leaders. You should adapt it to your needs, and share what worked for you.</p>

          <h6>PLAY 1</h6>
          <h2 class="display">Choose a challenge</h2>
          <p>The Opportunity Project is about solving real-world problems facing individuals and communities, like creating tools that help unemployed Americans find nearby jobs that match their skills, low-income families find affordable homes accessible to transportation and quality schools, and local leaders use information to advocate for neighborhood resources. You can identify an issue to focus on from a range of sources, and we encourage you to be concrete in defining the problems you want to solve.</p>

    <h3 id="checklist">Checklist</h3>
    <ul class="usa-unstyled-list">
      <li>To identify a meaningful challenge, you might want to connect with federal agencies, local leaders, community groups or other subject matter experts who are mission-driven and close to challenges on the ground.</li>
      <li>Make sure to choose a challenge where a new digital tool that uses <a href="http://opportunity.census.gov/build.html#datainventory">federal and local data</a> would be helpful.</li>
      <li>Ask yourself whether it is realistic for you to develop something that could have a meaningful impact on this problem.</li>
      <li>Work directly with stakeholders and future users of your tool as early as you can! This is critical step in building a useful tool, but one that is easy to overlook. Don’t skip it!</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="resources">Resources</h3>
    <ul class="usa-unstyled-list">
      <li><a href="https://data.world/opportunity/problem-statements">Challenges articulated by federal agencies</a> to address national priorities. We want teams to continue identifying creative new approaches to address these challenges in communities around the country.</li>
      <li>Detailed <a href="http://opportunity.census.gov/build.html#userscenarios">user-scenarios </a> offered through the Opportunity Project that can help you identify real-world challenges that affect people’s lives.</li>
      <li>The challenge can also come from a newly released dataset or <a href="http://opportunity.census.gov/build.html#datainventory">combination of datasets</a> that help to understand and solve important problems. For example, the Department of Labor worked with the University of Chicago to release an exciting new API that combines skills data with labor market data. Tech teams collaborated with policy-makers to build tools that, in addition to their direct impact on users, showed what could be done with this data.</li>

              <h6>PLAY 2</h6>
              <h2 class="display">Team up</h2>
              <p>Collaboration is an essential part of the Opportunity Project process! You can team up with others before or after identifying a problem statement to be sure you have all the skills and perspectives you need to build a useful, high quality digital tool. Your goal is to recruit a team of people to work together, which might include technologists, government leaders, subject matter experts, and end-users, and think about other ways to add diversity to your team.</p>

        <h3 id="checklist">Checklist</h3>
        <ul class="usa-unstyled-list">
          <li>Connect with a diverse set of collaborators with the knowledge and skills to create a user-centered tool with a path to adoption. This might include data experts, techies, designers, community leaders, and people who are the target users of the tool.</li>
          <li>Make sure these partners include people who work directly on issues related to your challenge and ideally people experiencing the problem directly, or people who work closely with them.</li>
          <li>Universities can be a great place to start since they are full of people with a wide variety of skills and perspectives, including community and policy subject matter experts and technologists.</li>

          <h2 class="display">Co-create the vision</h2>
          <p>Collaborate to identify user needs and create a use case that outlines who you are targeting and how they might interact with a solution to address the challenge you selected. We value co-creation – working directly with end users of the tool, so that you’re building <em>with</em> them, and not just <em>for</em> them. The problems you’re going to tackle when working to make communities more equitable are complex, and no one person has all the answers. Working together with a diverse team, including people who are experiencing the problem directly, will help you to recognize your blind spots.</p>

    <h3 id="checklist">Checklist</h3>
    <ul class="usa-unstyled-list">
      <li>Work with subject matter experts and end-users to understand the challenge and the gaps that you might help fill. Answer questions such as: How do people experience the problem? Do they have any tools to help them currently? What tools do they wish they had?</li>
      <li>Create a detailed use-case to guide your efforts.</li>
      <li>Remember what Jakob Nielsen once said, “One of usability’s most hard-earned lessons is that ‘you are not the user.’ If you work on a development project, you’re atypical by definition. Design to optimize the user experience for outsiders, not insiders.”</li>

            <p>We believe that by working together and combining different types of public data, we can build more equitable communities and expand access to opportunity. These public government data sets belong to all of us, and together we can use them to help solve many problems.  To help you use this information, we pulled together some of the best federal and local open data sets for information on local access to opportunity, things like proximity to jobs, transportation, affordable housing and quality schools.</p>

      <h3 id="checklist">Checklist</h3>
      <ul class="usa-unstyled-list">
        <li>Start by checking out the Opportunity Project <a href="http://opportunity.census.gov/build.html#datainventory">data dictionary</a>. Browse the data, and download a metadata file with info on the year, format, and a brief, plain-language description of what’s in each data set.</li>

      <h2 class="display">Build iteratively and collaboratively</h2>
      <p>Once you identify a problem to tackle, the end users your tool will serve, and the data you will use, start building and sharing your experience with the Opportunity Project community! Work collaboratively to build a software product, including many voices and seeking feedback as much as possible throughout, especially from people who are the target end-users of what you’re building. You can use a sprint process to organize your time, like a semester, training program, or a software development sprint. For example, the Opportunity Project started with an eight-week software development sprint. Tech developers, experts, community leaders, people from federal and local government and others came together, chose problems to work on, and formed teams.  These groups talked regularly on Slack, and all came together in web hangouts every two weeks to demo their works in progress, ask questions, and share feedback. After eight weeks, they all launched their products together at the White House and continued to improve them and share them with the target end users.</p>

<h3 id="checklist">Checklist</h3>
<ul class="usa-unstyled-list">
  <li>Before you start, think about how you will track success and the reach of your tool, such as tracking downloads or visitors, and learning more from users about how the product is influencing what they do and how.</li>
  <li>Identify the path for adoption once the tool is released – how will you connect end users with your product?  - Engage target end users, advocates, and subject matter experts early and often in the design process. Collect feedback through user testing sessions or design demos.</li>
  <li>If you’re interested in replicating the Opportunity Project sprint process and timeline, here’s what it looks like week-by-week:
    <ol>
      <li>Before kickoff: Identify a cohort of technologists, government representatives, subject matter experts, and community groups. Create a listserv and/or an online community where everyone can chat (for example: a Slack channel).</li>
      <li>Week 1: Teams choose problem statements.</li>
      <li>Week 2: Teams dig into the data and start designing and building.</li>
      <li>Week 3: “Alpha” demo of the tools in-progress so teams can get early feedback from a diverse audience of end users, subject matter experts, government employees, and others.</li>
      <li>Week 4: Teams continue building while collaborating and getting more feedback along the way.</li>
      <li>Week 5: Do another demo! Teams share more advanced versions of the tools and get more feedback, particularly from end users of the tool.</li>
      <li>Week 6: Teams keep building, doing interactive user testing sessions, and refining the tool.</li>
      <li>Week 7:  Get ready to share the tools with the world. De-bug. Plan how to share the final products.</li>
      <li>Week 8:  Everyone involved in the process joins together to launch the prototypes or final products.</li>
      <li>Week 9 and beyond: Continued improvement of the tools, getting the word out, sharing the product with the target end users, and measuring your impact.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="resources">Resources</h3>
<ul class="usa-unstyled-list">
  <li>Identify subject matter experts and other collaborators on Slack.</li>
  <li>Software developers can also use <a href="https://opportunity-slack.herokuapp.com/">Slack</a> or <a href="https://github.com/uscensusbureau/opportunity">GitHub</a> to share code, ask questions, post new suggested data sets, share feedback on data, and more.</li>

      <h2 class="display">Share your tool with the world</h2>
      <p>Make a splash when you release your tool! We’ve had success launching multiple tools at once, which draws more attention to the tools, the data, the approach, and all the collaborators who were involved.  This could be through a coordinated event in-person, online, or on social media.  After you’ve created a useful, user-centered digital tool, be sure to actually get it in the hands of your target end-users!  Hopefully you have been working closely with end-users and advocacy groups that represent them throughout the process, so those members of your team can help to adopt the tool and share it with others.  A marketing campaign, social media, or a launch event can also help to get the word out.</p>

<h3 id="checklist">Checklist</h3>
<ul class="usa-unstyled-list">
  <li>Consider whether to host an event to showcase your tools.</li>
  <li>Use press and social media to spread the word! Use #OpportunityProject.</li>
  <li>Be sure to get it in the hands of end-users and their advocates so that your work can have the greatest possible impact on real world problems.</li>
  <li>Share your code! Teams are highly encouraged to make all resulting software and tools open source and free for use by the public.</li>
</ul>

<ul class="usa-unstyled-list">
