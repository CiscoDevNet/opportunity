      <h3>What is "Opportunity?"</h3>
      <p>
        We think of 'opportunity' as:
        <ul>
          <li>access to the resources and services that a family, individual, or community needs to thrive, and</li>
          <li>freedom from the stressors that detract from the family, individual, or community's ability to thrive.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
