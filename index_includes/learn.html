          Now, as a nation, we don't promise equal outcomes, but we were founded on the idea everybody should have an equal opportunity to succeed. No matter who you are, what you look like, where you come from, you can make it. That's an essential promise of America. <strong>Where you start should not determine where you end up.</strong>

      <h3>What is "Opportunity?"</h3>
      <p>
        We think of 'opportunity' as:
        <ul>
          <li>access to the resources and services that a family, individual, or community needs to thrive, and</li>
          <li>freedom from the stressors that detract from the family, individual, or community's ability to thrive.</li>
        </ul>

      <p>In early 2016, the White House, the U.S. Departments of Census, Commerce, and Housing and Urban Development facilitated a process in which tech developers worked with subject matter experts and cities to build digital tools that help families, community leaders, local officials, and the media to access what they need to thrive.
