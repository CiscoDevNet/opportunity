      <p class="usa-font-lead">The Open Opportunity Data development process seeks to expose the current, unequal geography of opportunity â€“ the fact that today, opportunity is not evenly distributed. We are committed to changing that, so that a young person's zip code does not determine her destiny.</p>

      <h3>What is "Opportunity?"</h3>

      <p>
        For the purposes of Open Opportunity Data development, opportunity is defined as:
        <ul>
          <li>access to the resources and services that a family, individual, or community needs to thrive, and</li>
          <li>freedom from the stressors that detract from the family, individual, or community's ability to thrive.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      </p>

      <p>This effort culminated with a convening at the White House on March 7. Learn more! fact sheet, video, photos (neighborland?)</p>
