        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p> The Decennial Census is the largest peacetime mobilization in the United States and one of the most consequential pillars of U.S. democracy. It determines congressional redistricting and apportionment, the distribution of $675B of annual federal funding, and the formation of countless decisions for policy, business, and planning. The stakes are high — the effects of the 2020 Census will be felt for at least a decade. In a rapidly changing world, in the face of new and increasing challenges and opportunities, our mandate remains as it has been since 1790: to ensure that everyone is counted once, only once, and in the right place.  </p>
        <p> <strong> But there are serious challenges to ensuring a complete and accurate count. They include: </strong> <p>
        <ul>
          <li> Rapidly declining response rates, especially within populations considered “Hard to count” such as children under 5, urban and rural low-income households, households with poor internet access, and more </li>
          <li> Decreased trust in the government </li>
          <li> Increased social polarization </li>
          <li> A lack of up-to-date, accurate, and quality content on the internet, and an increasing volume of disinformation </li>

        <h3> Potential Solutions </h3>

          <li> An in-house marketing team looking to flex its creative muscles in a new way</li>

        <p> Community-based organizations that serve hard-to-count populations will play the role of <strong>user advocates</strong> to ensure that content serves people in an appropriate cultural, historical, and language context. </p>
        <p> We are also assembling <strong>experts and foundations</strong> to participate in framing and distributing the message. </p>
